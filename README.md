# ☢️ Holographic Reactor - Engineering Suite

> **"Where Physics Meets Cyberpunk."**

**[🔴 LIVE DEMO: LAUNCH REACTOR](https://abhidev-ig.github.io/RPM_Converter/)**

An advanced engineering unit converter and calculator wrapped in a futuristic, 3D holographic interface. This project combines rigorous mechanical engineering tools with immersive web design.

## 🚀 Features

### 🛠️ Engineering Tools
*   **RPM Converter**: Real-time conversion of RPM to Frequency (Hz), Angular Velocity (Rad/s), and Degrees/s.
*   **Dyno Mode**: Calculate **Power Output (kW & HP)** based on input Torque and RPM.
*   **CNC Mode**: Calculate **Surface Speed (m/s)** for machining operations based on tool diameter.
*   **Transmission Mode**: Simulate gear ratios, calculating output RPM and Torque multiplication ($N_1:N_2$).

### 🌌 Visual Immersion
*   **3D Parallax Cockpit**: The interface moves and reacts to your mouse position.
*   **Warp Speed Grid**: The background accelerates into a hyperspace blur as RPM increases.
*   **Reactor Heartbeat**: The core physically pulses in sync with the engine intensity.
*   **Cinematic Boot**: A retro-BIOS initialization sequence runs on startup.

### 🎮 Gamification
*   **Core Stabilization**: A mini-game where you must maintain RPM within a drifting "Stability Zone" to score points.
*   **Flight Recorder**: Real-time graphing of RPM data to track stability and performance.
*   **Overdrive System**: Disengage safety limiters to push beyond 6000 RPM (Warning: Reality Glitches may occur).

## 💻 Tech Stack
*   **HTML5 / CSS3**: CSS Variables, 3D Transforms (Perspective), Flexbox/Grid.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Audio API (Oscillators/Filters), Canvas API (Graphing), DOM Manipulation.
*   **Web Audio API**: Procedural engine sound synthesis that changes pitch with RPM.
